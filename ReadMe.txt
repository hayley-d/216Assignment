
Storing Images as Link:
-----------------------------------------
Storing images as URL links instead of Base64-encoded strings offers several advantages, including storage efficiency
and improved performance. URLs are typically shorter than Base64-encoded data, reducing the amount of storage space
required for image storage. This can be particularly beneficial when dealing with a large number of images or when
storage costs are a concern.

Additionally, retrieving images via URLs can result in better performance compared to decoding Base64 strings. Decoding
Base64 data can be computationally expensive, especially for large images, whereas URLs can be efficiently processed by
browsers and servers, leading to faster image loading times.

Furthermore, using URLs allows for better integration with content delivery networks (CDNs) and caching mechanisms.
CDNs can cache images at edge locations, reducing the load on the origin server and improving image delivery speeds.
Caching mechanisms can also be used to store images locally, further enhancing performance.

Overall, storing images as URL links provides a more efficient and scalable solution for managing images in web
applications, offering benefits in terms of storage efficiency, performance, and integration with CDN and caching mechanisms.
